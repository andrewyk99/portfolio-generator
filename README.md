# Portfolio Generator
Portfolio Generator is an application that does exactly what the title suggests. It is a frontend application that uses Node.js that gives the user a series of questions to answer and then automatically generator a portfolio! It will asks the questions in the terminal and then notify the user that the `index.html` was created successfully.

## Features
1. Users are asked a series of questions that will be reflected on the index.html.
2. Users will add an 'About Me' section.
3. Users can add one or more projects.
4. Users can pick a project to feature more prominently.
5. Users can add the links to the GitHub repository of the project they are including.
6. Users can add which technologies they used from a list.

## User Story
As a user, I want an application that will automatically build my portfolio so that I don't have to style or write any of the HTML myself. I want the portfolio to include my GitHub username, an 'About Me', any projects I want to include, a show off project, as well as GitHub repository links. I want an already well styled portfolio so I don't have to write the CSS myself.
